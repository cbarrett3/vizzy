# Vizzy MVP - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Product Vision

Vizzy aims to revolutionize data visualization development by bridging the gap between natural language and production-ready D3.js code. Following 21st.dev's successful model, we're creating an MCP server that transforms simple commands into beautiful, React-integrated visualizations. Our focus is on developer experience first - making D3.js accessible without sacrificing its power.

## 2. Target Users

Our primary users are developers using Cursor/Cline who need to rapidly implement data visualizations without compromising on quality. They value clean, maintainable D3.js code that follows best practices and integrates seamlessly with React and TypeScript. Secondary users include data scientists and analysts who need to quickly prototype visualizations, and AI agents requiring chart generation capabilities.

## 3. Core Features

### MCP Server

The heart of our system is a sophisticated natural language processing server that understands visualization intent. When a developer requests "a bar chart showing monthly revenue," the system doesn't just generate code â€“ it considers data structure, recommends appropriate visual encodings, and ensures the resulting visualization follows D3.js best practices while integrating seamlessly with React.

For MVP, we focus on three essential chart types:

- Bar charts (single and grouped)
- Line charts (with optional trend lines)
- Scatter plots (with optional regression lines)

### Developer Experience

Our web interface serves as both documentation hub and playground, featuring:

- Interactive documentation with live examples
- Visual playground for testing commands
- User dashboard for API key management
- Clear integration guides for Cursor/Cline

## 4. Technical Requirements

The system generates production-ready React components with:

- Clean, documented D3.js code
- TypeScript types for data props
- TailwindCSS styling
- Responsive design patterns
- Basic accessibility features

## 5. Implementation Timeline

### Days 1-2: Foundation

- Project setup with Next.js, TypeScript, TailwindCSS
- MCP server with API key authentication
- Basic chart generation system

### Days 3-4: Core Features

- Implement three core chart types
- Add TypeScript type generation
- Build template composition system

### Days 5-6: User Interface

- Create landing page with pricing tiers
- Build interactive documentation
- Implement playground

### Day 7: Launch Preparation

- Comprehensive testing
- Performance optimization
- Documentation review
- NPM package release

## 6. Commercial Model

Following 21st.dev's proven approach:

### Free Tier

- 5 chart generations per month
- Access to basic chart types
- Documentation and examples

### Standard Tier ($10/month)

- 50 chart generations per month
- Priority support
- Advanced customization options

### Pro Tier ($30/month)

- 200 chart generations per month
- Custom themes
- Premium support

## 7. Success Metrics

- 95% success rate for chart generation
- Sub-500ms average response time
- First-try success rate > 80%
- Time to first chart < 30 seconds

## 8. Future Considerations

While maintaining MVP focus, our architecture supports future expansion to:

- Additional chart types and variations
- Framework expansions (Vue, Svelte)
- Advanced animations and interactions
- Template gallery and sharing

## Conclusion

Vizzy represents the next evolution in developer tooling for data visualization. By combining natural language processing with best-in-class D3.js code generation, we're creating a tool that will become essential to modern web development workflows.
